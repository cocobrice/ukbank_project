# UK Bank Stock Price Analysis

As part of a project for Udacity Data Science nanodegree I have completed a capstone project and written a blogpost with my findings. The purpose of my project is to construct models to predict the stock prices of banks using financial data available at yahoo finance with the additional feature of UK 10 year projected funding rates from the Bank of England.
